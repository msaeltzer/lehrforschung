40469;<U+0001F6A8><U+0001F6A8><U+0001F6A8> I just filed an official ethics complaint against Jack Smith with the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility for his illegal election interference. It’s obvious to any reasonable observer that Jack Smith is trying to interfere with the 2024 election and stop the American people from electing Donald Trump. At every turn, he has sought to accelerate his illegal prosecution of President Trump for the clear (if unstated) purpose of trying him before the November election. The Justice Department’s own policies clearly prohibit Smith from doing so, and as a DOJ employee he is bound by those policies. Moreover, when the district court imposed a stay on the proceedings, Smith and his office ignored it and continued to file discovery documents. Smith’s conduct has brought disrepute to the Department of Justice and the entire federal government, and the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility should impose the discipline that such conduct warrants. Read my full complaint below: April 30, 2024 Jeffrey Ragsdale, Counsel Office of Professional Responsibility United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 3266 Washington, D.C. 20530-0001 Re: Complaint of Election Interference Against Biden Special Counsel Jack Smith Mr. Ragsdale: I write today to request an ethics investigation of Biden Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith for abusing the resources of the federal government to unlawfully interfere with the 2024 presidential election. Jack Smith’s multiple attempts to rush to trial the federal January 6th case against President Trump violated long-standing, explicit Justice Department policy. Further, Jack Smith’s repeated violations of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia’s stay of proceedings are a lawless breach of trial ethics and lawyerly conduct. Jack Smith’s actions brought disrepute to the Justice Department and the federal government as a whole, and he should face discipline appropriately. ATTEMPTING TO EXPEDITE TRIAL IN VIOLATION OF DOJ POLICY In June 2023, Biden special counsel Jack Smith obtained an indictment against President Donald J. Trump. The indictment charges President Trump with several offenses in relation to the Capitol riot of January 6, 2021. President Trump is now the presumptive Republican nominee for President, having won enough delegates to secure the nomination on March 12, 2024. As we will demonstrate, Biden special counsel Jack Smith is attempting to expedite the trial in order to influence the general election in November. This conduct violates Section 9-85.500 of DOJ’s Justice Manual to which Jack Smith is bound.1 Section 9-85.500 dictates that “[f]ederal prosecutors . . . may never select the timing of any action . . . for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.” Jack Smith first violated this rule when–in August 2023–he petitioned the District Court for a January 2, 2024, trial date. There exist approximately thirteen million pages of discovery for President Trump to review, plus thousands of hours of camera footage. Prosecutors bringing a case of this complexity–with so many consequential and novel legal issues to sort out–would normally never seek to bring it to trial within five months. The only reason to push for such an early trial date was to work to get the case tried before the November election, and the Justice Department Manual clearly forbids Jack Smith from taking any action on that basis. Biden special counsel Jack Smith next violated this Justice Department provision when he petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari before judgment in December.2 This extraordinary petition sought to bypass the normal appellate process, which involves a decision by a Court of Appeals panel and, possibly, review by the en banc court. Jack Smith asserted that it was “imperative” for the Supreme Court to grant his highly unusual request,3 but on December 22, 2023, the Supreme Court denied Jack Smith’s petition. That Jack Smith was solely motivated by the desire to interfere in the November election was effectively proven two months later. In February, President Trump petitioned for certiorari on the issue of presidential criminal immunity for official acts.4 Biden special counsel Jack Smith—having supported certiorari just two months earlier—now opposed certiorari. Jack Smith effectively repudiated his own arguments from two months earlier, with little explanation for his about-face other than his naked assertion that “[t]he nation has a compelling interest in the prompt resolution of this case.”5 Opp. To Pet. For Cert. at 34-35. Aside from the upcoming election, what “compelling interest” does the public have in the prompt resolution of this case? Why should this interest—based on an unstated reason—override the due process rights of a criminal defendant? (truncated);https://www.facebook.com/100044002275306/posts/994806478662752;8;1

1071;"Justice Samuel Alito’s use of election subversion symbols calls into question his ability to remain impartial on any cases before the Supreme Court relating to the insurrection of January 6th, 2021, results of the 2020 election, or Donald Trump himself. I joined my colleagues in a letter to Justice Alito calling for his recusal. He refused to recuse; blaming his wife for flags and implying our call for his recusal was “motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases.” According to SCOTUS’s own “Code of Ethics”, Mr. Alito must uphold the integrity of the Supreme Court by avoiding even the appearance of impartiality or association with political activity. His response to our letter is simply unacceptable.

58627;"Good evening, and welcome to our Weekend Update. Yesterday, Iran launched a heinous attack against Israel. The United States must always stand unequivocally with our great ally. We remain committed to our closest partner in the Middle East, and such a vicious attack cannot stand. My prayers are with the people of Israel in the wake of this ruthless attack. Last night, President Donald J. Trump's campaign held a rally in Schnecksville, Lehigh County. It was a large, enthusiastic crowd of Pennsylvanians fired up to re-elect Trump and our GOP ticket. I was honored to address the crowd before President Trump spoke. Click here or below to hear my remarks. I focused my remarks on the destructive, damaging and deadly policies of the Biden administration to the U.S. and the world. I contrasted that reality with the strong economy and global stability we had under President Trump. In order to truly get America on the right, crucial direction to strengthen our national security and our economy, all American-loving citizens must vote...Vote early, vote by mail, vote on Election Day. This is the most important election of our lifetime. Vote and volunteer to help contact infrequent voters or voters who lost confidence in elections, we all must vote to put America on track to be great again. Pictured below with Shelley and congressional candidate Maria Montero (PA-7). Pictured below with Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity. Stacy got a great shoutout from President Trump. Congressman Lloyd Smucker and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer in Pennsylvania meeting President Trump. President Trump provided our campaign with his full endorsement, and I am proud to have his support. When you peel back the onion on the Biden Administration, all you want to do is cry. Nothing is being done from a tax, regulatory, or fiscal responsibility standpoint that is helping drive or strengthen our economy. This Administration’s policies have been devastating to American small businesses. I joined ""Mornings with Maria"" on Fox Business to discuss. Click here or below to watch. Under Biden’s disastrous border policies, we have drugs poisoning our nation’s youth, human trafficking, rising crime in our cities, and now rampant squatting by illegal immigrants. My recently introduced SHIELD Act will make illegal immigrants think twice before squatting in an American’s home by making trespassing a deportable offense. I joined ""Fox & Friends Weekends"" on Fox News to discuss. Click here or below to watch. The dramatic increase in the number of illegal immigrants squatting in American homes is yet another example of how the disastrous situation at our southern border is impacting communities across the country. That’s why I introduced the SHIELD Act, which would make trespassing a deportable offense for illegal aliens and deem the alien permanently inadmissible for entry into the United States. Click here or below to learn more about my recently introduced legislation. This legislation will serve as a deterrent and make illegals think twice before attempting to trespass on or unlawfully possess an American’s property. Click here or below to watch my remarks on the House floor. The Fourth Amendment protects our citizens against warrantless searches and seizures. And while we must ensure that national security is as strong as it needs to be, we must also safeguard the freedoms of the American people.

Click here or below to watch. IN NEWS YOU WON’T HEAR IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: Since Biden took office, overall prices have shot up by 19.4% — a MASSIVE hit on hardworking Americans. Nowhere is that price pain felt more than in the daily foods Americans buy. SINCE BIDEN TOOK OFFICE… Eggs are up 49.3%. Gas is up 47.8%. Peanut butter is up 40.1%. Crackers are up 38.2%. Flour is up 33.5%. Butter/margarine is up 32%. Salad dressing is up 30.6%. Baby food is up 30.5%. Sugar is up 29.1%. Frozen vegetables are up 28.2%. Bakery products are up 26.7%. Soups are up 26.4%. Steaks are up 24.8%. Chicken is up 23.9%. Pet food is up 23.7%. Bread is up 23.7%. Cereal is up 22.5%. Coffee is up 19.6%. Milk is up 15%. Overall, grocery prices have surged by 21.1% since Biden took office. That’s a massive drag on Americans already paying more for almost everything during the Biden administration. These unending price hikes (which Biden promised would be “transitory” but was lying) have decimated Americans’ finances. Nearly two-thirds of Americans reported living paycheck-to-paycheck last year — an increase from 2022 — as credit card debt hits record highs and savings accounts dwindle.

2399;Yesterday, a long with a lot of you, I watched as the word guilty rang out across a NY City courtroom 34 times. For the first time in American history a former President of the United States is a convicted felon. We have truly crossed the Rubicon. Now, we the people, must make a choice. Do we stand for the rule of law and the democratic principles that have guided us for nearly 250 years? Or do we throw it all away based on the capricious, child-like rantings of an obvious narcissist who declares the system rigged only when he loses? Trump’s reaction is akin to a six-year old on the floor flailing his arms and legs and screaming “this is not fair” at the top of his lungs. The GOPs response as a whole is no better, essentially defaulting to the idea that their “dear leader” can do no wrong. (I would like to reserve thanks to Sen. Hoyer and former Governor Atchison for their comments calling for respecting the legal process, but they are the only two republicans to publically rise to this challenge thus far.) This is a case that was turned down by the Department of Justice. It was deemed non-prosecutable by the previous DA. Mr. Bragg decided otherwise upon his election and brought the case before a grand jury. Those folks determined enough evidence existed to go to trial. A 22 week trial took place and that evidence was heard by 12 people who, in turn, unanimously agreed that crimes were committed and rendered a guilty verdict. In short, a textbook example of how the legal system works. Obviously, it is not over. There will be multiple appeals and, frankly, there are several areas of this case that I think need to be looked at more closely. And I have faith that we will take that look because I believe in the fundamental American ideas that we are all created equal and no man is above the law. In the meantime, we now have a convicted felon vying to occupy the most powerful office in the world and neither conviction nor jail time will prevent him from being on the ballot in November where it is becoming increasingly clear that we are faced with the choice of continuing our grand American experiment or handing the reins to an increasingly unhinged demagogue who demands loyalty to Trump over and above loyalty to God, loyalty to family, and loyalty to Country.

64685;<U+0001F6A8> ALERT: FAKE POLL LYING ABOUT TRUMP <U+0001F6A8> Friends, did you see that President Donald J. Trump has endorsed my campaign for Congress? President Trump endorsed me because he knows I'm the America First candidate in the race who will build the wall, fight crime, stop the out-of-control spending, reduce the price of energy, defend the sanctity of life, and send Jared Golden and Joe Biden packing. President Trump is our Republican presidential nominee, and he knows it’s critical to win this congressional seat to be able to pass his agenda through Congress. Winning this seat is key to President Trump defeating Joe Biden. Mainers should know that Trump didn’t make this endorsement lightly. But instead of supporting and helping President Trump win, my opponent & his allies have decided to attack Trump -- even using liberal Democrat Jared Golden's words to disparage President Trump! It’s disappointing and very telling. In fact, we just heard about a fake poll Team Soboleski and/or their allies were doing over the weekend falsely attacking me and telling flat out lies -- such as that Trump hasn't endorsed me -- when they know full well that he has! Unfortunately, my opponents are proving that they will say and do anything for political power, and you can’t believe a single word of their attacks. These attacks are untrue, sad, and an act of desperation. President Trump knows they’re lies, and that’s why he has my back. Please join us and President Trump in fighting back against these lies whenever you hear them. Thank you for your support.;https://www.facebook.com/100078964809731/posts/407300528578771;12;1

45125;"My Campaign for New York’s 22nd Congressional District Has Come to an End Upon review of the objections to my petitions by a member of the Hood campaign, it was determined by the State BOE that my campaign’s volunteer efforts in obtaining the required number of registered Democratic Party signatures to get on the primary ballot fell short by a small number. While I am disappointed that the Hood campaign engaged in a egregious effort, which intentionally sought to keep me off the primary ballot and deny Democratic voters an opportunity to decide upon my candidacy for Congress, I nonetheless want to thank my volunteers and supporters who shared my desire to broaden the base of the Democratic Party and to address critical issues affecting New York’s 22nd Congressional District as well as the nation such as: A. Growing threats to the nation’s democracy from the mainstreaming of political extremism and authoritarianism B. The nation’s unique epidemic of gun violence and mass murder associated with gun violence, and the growing threat posed by ongoing production and distribution of weapons of mass destruction such as AR15s C. Combating Poverty and Environmental racism D. Building coalitions among historically marginalized communities across race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and geographic boundaries by tackling systemic attacks against reproductive healthcare rights, Affirmative Action, voting rights, LGBTQIA rights, working families and labor union rights. E. Protecting Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, education, Pre-K to Higher Education, veterans programs, and the environment F. Fighting for comprehensive immigration reform economic development, tax reform as well as strong federal support for law enforcement and social justice initiatives. My friends, I have consistently maintained that the 2024 electoral cycle will be a historic battle for the soul of the nation. It will help determine who shall have unadulterated access to US citizenship and who we will be on the global stage. Furthermore, as a scholar of American democracy at the intersection of race, class, gender, and ethnicity I am deeply convinced that we are in one of the most important civil rights moments in the 21st century. That being said, I had hoped that all Democratic Congressional candidates and their respective campaigns would abide by the unwritten rule that as Democrats we would not target and/or attack one another. That no matter how different our respective approaches, we were to be united on two goals: the removal of NY 22’s GOP incumbent and MAGA ideologue, Brandon Williams; and shifting the balance of power to Democrats in the House of Representatives. Apparently, that unwritten rule was inconvenient for the Hood campaign. They targeted my petitions and by extension targeted the signatures of supporters, many of whom are from historically marginalized communities across NY’s 22nd Congressional District. Because this campaign was first and foremost about responding to the political crisis in which we find ourselves, instead of blatant pursuit of a personal aspiration for high elective office, I will continue to work on these issues with the same passion I brought to my campaign. This includes working to ensure that the Democratic nominee prevails in November. In the end, all campaigns for elective office must be to advance diverse interests of the people, especially the most disadvantaged. If not, campaigns for elective office are merely about the corruptive pursuit of power. And power without love for our collective humanity and for justice, as Dr. King once warned, is “reckless and abusive.” Finally, I want to thank the many volunteers and supporters of my campaign for your incredible contributions.

76093;"David Stockman is right and I've been preaching this for years. Ezell voted with Pelosi and the Democrats to increase our debt. Heaven help us. The federal debt has been recently increasing by $1 trillion every 100 days. That’s $10 billion per day, $416 million per hour. In fact, Uncle Sam’s debt has risen by $470 billion in the first two months of this year to $34.5 trillion and is on pace to surpass $35 trillion in a little over a month, $37 trillion well before year’s end, and $40 trillion some time in 2025. That’s about two years ahead of the current CBO (Congressional Budget Office) forecast. On the current path, moreover, the public debt will reach $60 trillion by the end of the 10-year budget window. But even that depends upon the CBO’s latest iteration of Rosy Scenario, which envisions no recession ever again, just 2% inflation as far as the eye can see and real interest rates of barely 1%. And that’s to say nothing of the trillions in phony spending cuts and out-year tax increases that are built into the CBO baseline but which Congress will never actually allow to materialize. So when it comes to the projection that the 2034 debt will come in at just $60 trillion, we’ll take the wonders any day of the week. The fact that it will likely be much higher also means that the Washington UniParty’s prevailing fiscal policy path will lead to $100 trillion of public debt sometime in the early 2040s. And that means, in turn, that annual interest expense will then be greater than the entire federal budget during 2019. Needless to say, neither Trump nor Biden has said, ""Boo,"" about this looming calamity. Sleepy Joe has even had the audacity to brag that he has reduced the federal deficit by more than half. Then again, the starting point for that ludicrous proposition is the Trumpian lockdown/stimmy fueled disaster of 2020 when the deficit hit an astounding 16% of GDP. That figure represented a larger burden on the US economy than the peak WWII deficits when America was actually fighting two real enemies, as opposed to Dr. Fauci’s hyped-up super-flu.";https://www.facebook.com/100072195139558/posts/432819162467918;1;2

28789;While running for office is a daunting and exhausting task, it is also extremely rewarding. You get to meet tons of passionate Americans who care deeply about our country. And, along the way, you do make new friends. Last cycle, I was introduced to Roger Stone by a mutual friend. Now, Roger is an absolute heavyweight in Republican politics. If you haven’t seen “Get me Roger Stone”, I highly recommend it. Besides being a good friend of President Trump and an accomplished author, Roger has worked for every Republican president since Nixon. Fortunately, we have had the opportunity to break bread several times now, and we’ve done numerous podcasts together, talk regularly, and have developed a friendship over the past few years. So, when I decided to run for Congress this cycle, I asked if he would endorse me. He said, sure, and we worked up a press release and he provided a quote for it. I thought that was it. We announced that endorsement on Monday, and I figured that was it. And, in this world, that’s a pretty big deal. I was super grateful that he was willing to do it. However, much to my surprise today, Roger sends me a text this evening with this video. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. It’s important to note, I didn’t ask him to do this. I did not pay him to do this. He literally just did this to help me out, out of the kindness of his heart.

80032;I have been getting a lot of interest in my yes vote for the last 5 appropriations bills, much of it rather colorful. These slides and charts do a pretty good job of explaining why I voted for them. There is some real trash in there for sure but the good far outweighs the bad. Some people in my own party and in some organizations you think you could trust are fundraising off of Political Rage Porn and they should be ashamed of themselves. If we lose the majority in The House, the garbage spending will explode back to and become worse, than the Pelosi days, and it will be on their shoulders. Here is the undeniable, absolute garbage in the appropriations bills that I do not support. Some folks wanted me to vote against the bills for these reasons. This is one hell of a lot of money for sure. That is: 0.0001991% of the bills passed. Putting it into perspective with the total amount of the five bills, this would be the equivalent of you earning $1,000,000 a year and shutting your business down because you lost $0.01. I was and am, unwilling to do that. I will not always vote the way all of you want me to vote, but I will always have a very good reason for doing so and never shine you on about it.;https://www.facebook.com/100058077189071/posts/812955217317044;0;0

77910;#MOMNIBUSNOW One driving force of the U.S. maternal health crisis is a lack of access to maternity care, and to culturally congruent maternity care and support specifically. More than 1,000 American counties are “maternity care deserts,” with no hospitals offering obstetric care and zero obstetric providers, and more than 2.2 million women of childbearing age live in maternity care deserts. Women in maternity care deserts are more likely to have asthma and hypertension than women in counties with full access to maternity care,12 putting them at greater risk for pregnancy complications and pregnancy-related death. One solution to this glaring shortage is to grow and diversify the perinatal health workforce. The Perinatal Workforce Act makes historic investments to increase the number of maternity care providers and non-clinical perinatal health workers who offer culturally congruent care and support during and after pregnancy.;https://www.facebook.com/100044794400197/posts/935750477928090;0;0

52497;Gosar Statement on Supporting the Motion to Vacate the Speaker Washington, D.C. -- Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-09), issued the following statement after cosponsoring H.Res. 1103, Declaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant, also known as the motion to vacate. “Nearly 11 million illegal aliens have crossed our southern border in the past three years. My congressional district in Arizona, ground zero for the invasion, is getting pummeled by the surge of lawbreakers. These illegal aliens have brought violent crime, deadly drugs, human trafficking and are depleting resources and services meant for U.S. citizens. In fact, every state has become a border state. Communities across the country are being ravaged, families are being destroyed and Americans in need are being ignored. Congress cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the consequence of Biden’s disastrous open border policies, nor can it idly wait for Biden to halt this invasion through executive fiat. Congress has the responsibility to solve this crisis. Yet rather than spending the resources to secure our southern border and combating the invasion of 11 million illegals and despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the United States House of Representatives, under the direction of the Speaker, is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine. I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker. Our border cannot be an afterthought. We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,” concluded Congressman Gosar. ###;https://www.facebook.com/100044080644052/posts/987179966094682;0;0

50009;"Good morning! ”After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him. And all the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage. Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why do you transgress the king’s command?” And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew. And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury. But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus. In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king’s laws, so that it is not to the king’s profit to tolerate them. If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king’s business, that they may put it into the king’s treasuries.” So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. And the king said to Haman, “The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.” Then the king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king’s satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet ring. Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces with instruction to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day. The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.“ <U+202D><U+202D>Esther<U+202C> <U+202D>3<U+202C>:<U+202D>1<U+202C>-<U+202D>15<U+202C> <U+202D>ESV<U+202C><U+202C> ”When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and he cried out with a loud and bitter cry. He went up to the entrance of the king’s gate, for no one was allowed to enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth. And in every province, wherever the king’s command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and many of them lay in sackcloth and ashes. When Esther’s young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was. Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king’s gate, and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people. And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said. Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say, “All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law—to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live. But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.” And they told Mordecai what Esther had said. Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not think (truncated)";https://www.facebook.com/100057386202374/posts/935592451696953;0;0
