"49",45125,"My Campaign for New Yorkâ€™s 22nd Congressional District Has Come to an End Upon review of the objections to my petitions by a member of the Hood campaign, it was determined by the State BOE that my campaignâ€™s volunteer efforts in obtaining the required number of registered Democratic Party signatures to get on the primary ballot fell short by a small number. While I am disappointed that the Hood campaign engaged in a egregious effort, which intentionally sought to keep me off the primary ballot and deny Democratic voters an opportunity to decide upon my candidacy for Congress, I nonetheless want to thank my volunteers and supporters who shared my desire to broaden the base of the Democratic Party and to address critical issues affecting New Yorkâ€™s 22nd Congressional District as well as the nation such as: A. Growing threats to the nationâ€™s democracy from the mainstreaming of political extremism and authoritarianism B. The nationâ€™s unique epidemic of gun violence and mass murder associated with gun violence, and the growing threat posed by ongoing production and distribution of weapons of mass destruction such as AR15s C. Combating Poverty and Environmental racism D. Building coalitions among historically marginalized communities across race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and geographic boundaries by tackling systemic attacks against reproductive healthcare rights, Affirmative Action, voting rights, LGBTQIA rights, working families and labor union rights. E. Protecting Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, education, Pre-K to Higher Education, veterans programs, and the environment F. Fighting for comprehensive immigration reform economic development, tax reform as well as strong federal support for law enforcement and social justice initiatives. My friends, I have consistently maintained that the 2024 electoral cycle will be a historic battle for the soul of the nation. It will help determine who shall have unadulterated access to US citizenship and who we will be on the global stage. Furthermore, as a scholar of American democracy at the intersection of race, class, gender, and ethnicity I am deeply convinced that we are in one of the most important civil rights moments in the 21st century. That being said, I had hoped that all Democratic Congressional candidates and their respective campaigns would abide by the unwritten rule that as Democrats we would not target and/or attack one another. That no matter how different our respective approaches, we were to be united on two goals: the removal of NY 22â€™s GOP incumbent and MAGA ideologue, Brandon Williams: and shifting the balance of power to Democrats in the House of Representatives. Apparently, that unwritten rule was inconvenient for the Hood campaign. They targeted my petitions and by extension targeted the signatures of supporters, many of whom are from historically marginalized communities across NYâ€™s 22nd Congressional District. Because this campaign was first and foremost about responding to the political crisis in which we find ourselves, instead of blatant pursuit of a personal aspiration for high elective office, I will continue to work on these issues with the same passion I brought to my campaign. This includes working to ensure that the Democratic nominee prevails in November. In the end, all campaigns for elective office must be to advance diverse interests of the people, especially the most disadvantaged. If not, campaigns for elective office are merely about the corruptive pursuit of power. And power without love for our collective humanity and for justice, as Dr. King once warned, is â€œreckless and abusive.â€ù Finally, I want to thank the many volunteers and supporters of my campaign for your incredible contributions.

I intend to help change that though â€“ and I am our best chance to win in the Florida 16th Congressional District. I have a long history of fighting for reproductive freedom and economic parity for women. I also have been particularly active in fighting for security for seniors, since CD 16 is distinctive in its exceptionally high proportion of senior citizens. Most of all, I fear for our democracy, with too many Americans acquiescing in offenses against the Constitution and succumbing to racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic and otherwise bigoted notions. I am highly qualified to represent the interests of constituents in Southwest Florida and Americans generally. I graduated from Yale Law School and also earned a PhD in political science from Yale. Since then I have practiced law from Small Claims to the World Court, worked for the United Nations Environment Programme, taught law school courses, and published dozens of articles on legal and political issues. For further information, please see our website at VoteJan.com Also, please contribute to my campaign to promote our shared values and policies.
